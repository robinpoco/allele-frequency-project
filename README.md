# allele-frequency-project
This repository contains documentation for my MSc thesis project looking into rare variant-linked genes for alcohol use disorder (AUD), conducted at the [`CTGlab`](https://cncr.nl/ctg/) under supervision of Dr. Jeanne Savage. Computations for this project were performed on the cloud-based UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform (UKB-RAP) when dealing with participant data, under application number 16406. Individual-level data is available to approved researchers through the [`UKB`](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) 

All non-participant identifiable result are posted in: [`results/results_README.md`](results/results_README.md)

Scripts for machine learning model combining rare variant + common variants, CLI scripts to perform MAGMA burden scoring and PRScs on the UKB-RAP: [`scripts/scripts_README.md`](scripts/scripts_README.md)

Further documentation on UKB-RAP and work by CTG can be found [`here`](https://github.com/vu-ctg/ukb_rap_workflows/tree/master)

Full thesis is availble on request via [`LinkedIn`](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/robin-pocornie)
