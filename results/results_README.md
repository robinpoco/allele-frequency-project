# Results from MAGMA and ML model
All results without participant-identifiable information. 

RVG = rare variant-linked genes; PRS = polygenic risk scores; RVGW = genome-wide burden score for rare variants

For the machine learning model, we performed elastic net regression on on seven models:
1.	PRS only
2.	44 RVGs only 
3.	440 only 
4.	44 RVGs + PRS
5.	44 RVGs + PRS
6.	RVGW only
7.	RVGW + PRS
